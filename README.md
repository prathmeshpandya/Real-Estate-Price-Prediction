Project: Real Estate Price Prediction in Bengaluru

Project Overview:
This project aimed to develop a predictive model to estimate real estate property prices in Bengaluru, India. By leveraging a dataset containing various property attributes, the model sought to provide accurate price predictions for potential buyers and sellers.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The project commenced with the acquisition of a comprehensive dataset encompassing real estate properties in Bengaluru. The dataset included essential features such as square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, location, and the corresponding sale prices.To ensure data quality and model accuracy, a rigorous preprocessing phase was undertaken. This involved:

Data Cleaning: Identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers to maintain data integrity.

Data Visualization: Employing exploratory data analysis techniques to visualize the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and uncover potential patterns.

Outlier Removal: Employing statistical methods to detect and remove extreme values that could skew the model's predictions.

Feature Engineering:
To enhance the model's predictive power, feature engineering techniques were applied. This involved:

Creating New Features: 
Deriving additional features from existing data, such as calculating the property's price per square foot or proximity to specific landmarks.
Transforming Existing Features: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Model Development and Training:
A linear regression model was selected as the primary approach for predicting property prices. This choice was motivated by its simplicity, interpretability, and suitability for modeling linear relationships between variables.The model was trained on the preprocessed and engineered dataset, learning to establish a relationship between the property attributes and their corresponding sale prices. Hyperparameter tuning was considered to optimize the model's performance.

Model Evaluation:
To assess the model's effectiveness, various evaluation metrics were employed, including:

GridSearchCV:  used by optimizing the hyperparameters of the linear regression model. By systematically testing different combinations of hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength, learning rate), it identified the optimal settings that lead to the best model performance. This can improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the model, ultimately resulting in more reliable price predictions.

Web Application Development:
To make the model's predictions accessible to users, a web application was developed using Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allowed users to input property attributes (square footage, BHK, number of bathrooms, and location) and receive an estimated price based on the model's predictions.

Conclusion:
The successful completion of this project resulted in a predictive model capable of providing valuable insights into real estate prices in Bengaluru. The web application provided a user-friendly interface for accessing these predictions, empowering potential buyers and sellers with informed decision-making.
